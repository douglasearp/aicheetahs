Accelerated Development with Cursor AI & Claude AI, Google Gemini, Cursor Composer
Our development workflow leverages the most advanced AI-powered development tools available today, dramatically increasing productivity while maintaining enterprise-grade code quality. Cursor AI with Model Context Protocol (MCP) serves as our intelligent IDE, providing context-aware code generation, multi-file editing capabilities, and seamless integration with databases, APIs, and development tools. This allows us to understand entire codebases at once, enabling intelligent refactoring and architectural improvements that would take traditional development teams weeks to accomplish. Combined with Claude AI's Composer and Task Management features, we orchestrate complex multi-step development workflows, automate repetitive tasks, generate comprehensive documentation, and maintain coding standards across large projects. This AI-augmented approach allows us to deliver production-ready applications 3-5x faster than traditional development methods while reducing bugs and technical debt through intelligent code analysis and automated testing workflows.

Type: Enterprise Identity and Access Management
Core Capabilities:

Single sign-on (SSO) across applications
Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Conditional access policies
B2B and B2C identity management
Integration with Microsoft 365
OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support

AI Value Proposition:
Azure Entra secures AI systems handling sensitive data by enforcing enterprise-grade authentication and conditional access—ensuring AI-powered financial applications only allow access from approved devices and locations. For AI consulting serving multiple Fortune 50 clients, Entra enables centralized identity management where client employees access AI dashboards using their corporate credentials without separate logins. The platform's conditional access can restrict AI model access based on risk scores: if anomalous behavior is detected, require additional authentication before allowing access to AI-generated financial insights. Integration with Microsoft's compliance tools ensures AI systems meet SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR requirements automatically.

Auth0
Type: Customer Identity and Access Management Platform
Core Capabilities:

Universal login for any application
Social identity provider integration

The platform enables rapid experimentation with multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Mistral) through a unified interface, allowing teams to compare performance and costs before committing. Integration with Azure services means AI models can securely access enterprise data in SQL Server, Cosmos DB, or data lakes without data leaving the corporate network. AI Foundry's MLOps capabilities automate model retraining, A/B testing, and gradual rollouts—critical for financial AI systems where model performance directly impacts revenue.

LangGraph
Type: Framework for Building Stateful AI Agents
Core Capabilities:

Graph-based workflow orchestration for AI agents
Stateful multi-step AI reasoning
Human-in-the-loop approvals and interventions
Cyclic and conditional AI workflows
Integration with LangChain ecosystem
Persistent state management across sessions

AI Value Proposition:
LangGraph transforms simple AI models into sophisticated agents capable of multi-step reasoning and complex workflows essential for enterprise automation. For invoice processing, LangGraph orchestrates workflows where AI extracts data, validates against business rules, routes for approval when confidence is low, and automatically processes when confidence is high—reducing manual review by 80% while maintaining accuracy. The framework's state management allows AI agents to handle interruptions: if a payment approval process is paused, LangGraph maintains context so the agent resumes exactly where it left off. For AI consulting projects, LangGraph enables building custom AI workflows (document analysis → data extraction → validation → database update → notification) that adapt based on results, handle errors gracefully, and provide full audit trails for regulated industries.

Google AI Studio
